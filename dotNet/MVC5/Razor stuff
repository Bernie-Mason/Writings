MVC applications use Razor to generate HTML. Razor expressions can be used to tailor response to the user based on data values.

The Razor view engine is responsible for dynamically inserting content into the output sent to a browser. Razor views are compiled into C# classes in an MVC application where the base class it uses defines the layout property.

In a good MVC application, there is a well defined separation in the work that the controller's action methods and the views carry out.
An action method can pass a model object to the view but NOT formatted data. A view can use a the object that it's been pass to present data to the user but CANNOT change the nature of the view model object.

The difference between processing and formatting data. Views format data by taking the model object data and displaying it. Controllers process data, performing operations on the data to modify it.
