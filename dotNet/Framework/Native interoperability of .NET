Native interoperability of .NET

Every operating system includes an application programming interface (API) that provides the system services. .NET provides several ways to call those APIs. 

The main way to do native interoperability is via "platform invoke" or P/Invoke for short, which is supported across Linux and Windows platforms. A Windows-only way of doing native interoperability is know as "COM interop" which is used to work with COM components in manged code. It's built on top of the P/Invoke infrastructure, but it works in subtly different ways.
