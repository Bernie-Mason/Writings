Class Libraries

Class libraries can be constructed using .NET Framework, .NET Core or .NET Standard implementations. But what's the difference between them?

The .NET Standard library will be super compatible with other applications BUT will have a smaller .NET API surface are that the library can access.

The .NET Core library will have a larger .NET API surface area that the library can access but only .NET Core apps will be compatible with in.

For example, a library that targets .NET Standard 1.3 will be compatible will apps that target .NET Framework 4.6, .NET Core 1.0 and any other platform that supports it.
