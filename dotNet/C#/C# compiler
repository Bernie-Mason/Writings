C# compiler

csc.exe

The C#  compiler transforms code into a Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) as an executable. (something.exe)

MISL is consumed by the CLR. Your processor itself cannot transform code into native instrutions. It needs the CLR to transform the MISL into native instructions.

Assemblies are the files that the c# compiler creates for us. We need to use multiple assemblies to create programs.

An assembly can run under the supervision of the .NET CLR.

Assemblies are .exe or .dll. Another program can load a program and use the code inside. For  resuable code make dynamic link libraries.
	For VS, simply we can create dlls using the class libraries in vs rather than a console app.
	Note that it is perfectly legal to reference a dll or exe file for use of internal code. You are only not allowed to run a dll directly.

Core libraries live in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC)
	This is in the WIndows/Assembly folder. Lots of GAC folders here. The assemblies stored here are available to any .NET programs on the machine. One copy for the entire machine.

MSCORElib is a core library. It isn't listed in the assembly refrences as it's such a common assembly that it's usage is implied.
