Naming conventions

Capitalisation rules for identifiers
To differentiate words in an identifier, capitalize the first letter of each word.
Do not use underscores.
The PascalCasing convention, used for all identifiers except parameter names, capitalises the first character in each word. The camelCasing, convention is only used for parameter names.
