Static vs Non Static methods

Static methods are class methods rather than instance methods. The only real difference is that static methods have an additional hidden this parameter passed to it that allows you to access all the non-static fields in the object. A static method doesn't get the hidden 'this' parameter and therefore does not have access to any of the object's non-static field
