Arrays

Manage a collection of variables. Arrays have a fixed size. When creating an array we need to specify the size. If we know the size or maximum size of a collection an array is suitable.

Arrays and Lists are both zero indexed. 

Every type is a value type or a reference type
	Use struct to create a value type
	Use class to create a reference type
Arrays and strings are reference types
	Strings behave like a value type. They are immutable and you can only create new strings.
