Questions for Jim

1. What's the difference between:

	int[] numArray = new int[3] {....};

and

	Array numArray = Array.CreateInstance(typeof(int), 3)

There appears to be a difference in how they are talked to in the intermediate language? I also read that the first is usually desirable

2. Whenever we make changes to a string it creates a new string (thus the stringbuilder class) but why does it do this? Is it that difficult to modify a field on the heap? Does this happen for every object on the heap?

3. Why do value types inherit from the Object class?
