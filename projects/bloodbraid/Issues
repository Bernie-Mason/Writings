Card db issues

Some of the chinese cards have english card names. Only a few but some.

Card searching issues
-----------------------------

Split cards are currently two fetched as two seperate db entries. They are stored as seperate english entries even though they have the same multiverse id. 

Need to write a cache clear up that gets rid of the oldest downloaded cards. On application startup or closing.
