Running challenge update, January. (185 km covered, target 170 km). 

A really tough month! January has been a month of running in nasty conditions, getting cold, wet and very muddy. But I've also got to know a great new group of people; the Southville running club! My first run with them was in a torrential downpour and I succeeded in getting several blisters. I haven't been put off though and have been running regularly with the group. 

The pain of my running is laughable in comparison to the cold and hunger that homeless folk experience living outdoors in January. Luckily, in Bristol there's a great community interest company who are helping build homes for the homeless so they can get back on their feet. Check them out in the link below.
