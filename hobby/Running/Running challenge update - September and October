	Running challenge update - September and October
	May-June: 302 km covered (target 320 km). Total 1680 km this year.

	September and October were very tough months for me. I had a total of 15 days of illness taking a fair bit of time of work. For those who don't know, I was diagnosed with IBS earlier in the year. I had a couple of periods in the last month when my symptoms flared up very badly on several occasions and left me unable to run anywhere near as much as I would have liked. I've got a management plan in place and I've hopeful that I'll be able to complete my challenge. It's going to be very close though!

	On a brighter note, one of my local homeless friends got a job at a local pub (Wild Beer) and an apartment! He's still on the street every day selling paintings and drawings that he makes but it's great to see him move in a positive direction.

	A huge thanks once again to everyone who has donated so far. It really means a lot. Help Bristol's Homeless does great work so please consider donating if you have anything at all that you can spare. 

	Much love ❤️❤️❤️
	Bernie
