Running challenge update - Halfway through!
May-June: 375 km covered (target 320 km). Total 1093 km this year.

The end of June marks the midpoint of my challenge and, although I'm on track, I'm definitely feeling the burn! I rounded off May in South America and managed to run through the streets of Buenos Aires and on the Copacabana in Rio which was amazing. üèñÔ∏è In June I hit a personal best for kilometres run in a month (209).

A huge thanks once again to everyone who has donated so far. It really means a lot. Help Bristol's Homeless does great work so please consider donating if you have anything at all that you can spare. 

Much love ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
