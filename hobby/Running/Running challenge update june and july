Running challenge update - Very close!
November: 162 km covered. Total 1875 km this year.

November marks the start of the truly cold season and saw me reach for my thermals and fluorescent jacket. I spent a lot of time out in dark and wet conditions and my IBS hasn't made it any easier. As hard it has been for me it doesn't compare to spending a night in these conditions. Help Bristol's Homeless are an amazing charity and it's pleasure to support them in making life easier for Bristol's homeless.

Once again, thanks so much to everyone who has donated this year. The number of people who've wanted to chat to me about my challenge this year has been truly humbling. 

Thank you. ❤️❤️❤️
