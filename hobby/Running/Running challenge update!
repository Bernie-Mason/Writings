Running challenge update!
July-August: 332 km covered (target 325 km). Total 1423 km this year.

July marked a low point in my running this year with 10 days on stomach problems leading to my lowest month for total distance so far. In August I got my shoes back on and made up for lost time getting more than 200 km done.

Massive thanks once again to everyone who has donated so far. I still have about half of my target to reach so please consider donating if you have anything at all that you can spare. 

Much love ❤️❤️❤️
Bernie
