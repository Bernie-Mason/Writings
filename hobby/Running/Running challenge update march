Running challenge update
March: 192 km covered (target 175 km). Total 531 km this year.

Another month down and I'm a quarter of the way through my challenge! This month I had a few near misses in the snow and sleet.

Over the last couple of months I met one of the homeless chaps who lives in a tent just outside my apartment. His name is Shaun. He tries to sell magazines when he can but can't get the supply every week. He's gone through three tents this year because of people cutting them open to get to his cooking equipment. It was incredibly humbling getting to know someone for whom snow and bad weather are more than just an inconvenience.

Shaun and folk like him badly need somewhere to live to get back on their feet. Please consider donating, even a little, to Help Bristol Homeless. Much Love. B
