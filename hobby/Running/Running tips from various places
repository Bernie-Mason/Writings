Running tips

Matt Cama
 1. Shoulders slightly back and head up - this will help you breath better
 2. Arms slightly tucked into the rib cage.
 3. Activate your core - really important. Avoid excessive hip rotation once core is active. Will prevent back damage
 4. Feet position - where do you land on your feet. Land on the middle of your foot.
 5. Slight forward leaning. Don't have gravity directly onto hips, make it help you running.
 6. Breathe in with your nose and out with your mouth. Diaphragm breathing. 4/4 count for slower, 2/2 for faster
