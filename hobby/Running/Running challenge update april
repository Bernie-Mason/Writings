Running challenge update
April: 185 km covered (target 165 km). Total 717 km this year.

Four months down and it's fair to say that I'm already knackered! April was a pretty decent month for the weather but was also very tough on my feet and legs. I lost a couple of toenails and ended up with bad cramp on several occasions!
 
A massive thanks you to everyone who has donated towards my fund-raiser for Help Bristol Homeless so far. You guys rock. 

Help Bristol Homeless does great work so if you haven't donated and don't want to see my lost toenails going to waste please consider following the link below to help me in my challenge!
