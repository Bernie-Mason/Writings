Running challenge update - Complete!!
December: 141 km covered. Total 2002 km this year.

That's it! Over the year, I've run in 4 different countries, put my running shoes 136 times and spent a total of 186 hours (almost 8 days) out running. I've run in dark, wet, freezing, muddy and scolding conditions. The challenge has been much tougher on me than I thought it would but I'm very proud to complete it and raise money to help the homeless in Bristol.

I'm pretty close of achieving my target for Help Bristol Homeless. If you still want to donate I'll been leaving the page open for another week. For the final time, thank you to everyone who has donated this year!

Cheers ❤️
Bernie
