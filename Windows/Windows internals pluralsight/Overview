Tools
	We want to look at the OS from an internals perspective. We need tools!

	3 types
		Built in tools like
			Task manager
			Resource monitor
			Perf monitor
		SysInternals
			Obtained from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/
			These are free tools by Mark Russinovich
			No installation needed. Can therefore be put on a USB key and run on any system!
