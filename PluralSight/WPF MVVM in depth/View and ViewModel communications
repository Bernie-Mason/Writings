View and ViewModel communications

Commands, behaviors and attached properties

Commands
	These a methods that are bound to controls.
	Based on classic Command design pattern
	Invoker
		View control. Typically this is a UI element. Or a chunk of logic code
	Receiver
		ViewModel typically. Logic intended for execution. Typically a method in your ViewModel.
	Use delegating command implementation that sits in between these two to make sure that the invoker and receiver don't need to know about each other. 
		ICommand
		Supports a decoupled way of handling invocation
		Supports enabling/disabling of control

Attached properties and behaviors
	Relationship between them
Property changed notifications
