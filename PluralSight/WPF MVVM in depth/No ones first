No ones first

May have other code in control of constructing both View and ViewModel
Order does not matter
Set DataContext after constructing both.

Generally if there's a static relationship between the view and ViewModel we want to do View-first whereas if there's a more dynamic relationship then we can use ViewModel first to selectively figure out which View/ViewModel we actually want.
