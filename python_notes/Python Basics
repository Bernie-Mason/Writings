Python Basics


# Expressions can be entered directly into the Python interactive shell (just like a terminal) and consist of values (1,2,3 etc) and operators (+, - etc) that evaluate down to a single value.

# Types are not declared in Python but determined by the interpreter. A decimal point makes a number floating point (1.2) and single quotations makes a string 'string'. String concatenation can be done using the + operator as usual. 

# Although 

'Alice' + 4 

# Will not evaluate with a cast exception,

'Alice' * 4
->
'AliceAliceAliceAlice'

# Variables can be declared an initialised as normal. However, the type of the variable is not declared.

# Casting:
# e.g.
print('You will be ' + str(int(myAge) + 1) + ' in a year.')
# The str(), int() and float() functions will evaluate to the forms of the value you pass. Not int(1.99) evaluates to 1 (rounds down).

# My first python program

print('Hello world!')
print('What is your name?')
myName = input()
print('It is good to meet you, ' + myName)
print('The length of your name is:')
print(len(myName))
print('What is your age?')
myAge = input()
print('You will be ' + str(int(myAge) + 1) + ' in a year.')


# The input() function

# The input() function waits for the user to type some text on the keyboard and press enter. The function call evaluates to a string equal to the user's text, and the previous line of code assigns the myName variable to this string value.


# Flow control
# Boolean values are True and False. You know the rest

# e.g.
>>> (4 < 5) and (5 < 6)
True

# Left expression will be evaluated first, and then it will evaluate the right expression. When it knows each expression it will evaluate the whole expression down to one Boolean value.

# Elements of flow control
# Conditions: these are the boolean expressions
# Code blocks: These begin and end where indentation occurs. These can contain other blocks

# if statement

if name == 'Alice':		# Note the colon, all flow control statements end with one (like bashs '; then').
	print ('Hi, Alice.')
elif name == 'Bernie':
	print ('Go away!')
else:
	print ('Hi, whomever you are.')

# while statement

spam = 0
while spam < 5:
	print('Current spam levels are: ' + str(spam))
	spam++

# break statements
# To break execution out of loop early. If the execution reaches a break statement, it immediately exits the while loop's clause. 0
# continue statements
# Like break statements, continue statements are used inside loops. When the program execution reaches a continue statement, the program execution immediately jumps back to the start of the loop and reevaluates the loop condition.

# for loops and range() function
print('What\'s your name?')
name = input()
print('My name is: ')
for i in range(5):
	print (name)

# more range examples

range(0, 10, 2) (start, stop, inc)
