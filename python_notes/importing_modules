Importing modules

All Python programs can call a basic set of functions called built-in functions, including print(), input() and len(). Python also comes with a set of modules called the standard library. Each module is a Python program that contains a related group of functions that can be embedded in your programs. For example, the math module has mathematics related functions etc.

#!/usr/bin/env python 
import random
for i in range(5):
	print(random.randint(1,10))

Exit early with import sys
sys.exit()
