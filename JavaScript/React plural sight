TRADEOFFS

Framework vs Library
* Angular and Ember are frameworks but  React is a library. 
* A framework contains more opinions. Reduces decision fatigue. Can help cross-team consistency.

* React is much smaller than most frameworks. Can easily replace a single component in a page with React. Very lightweight. 
* Facebook migrated from server side PhP to React this way.
* Angular comes with many more features built in: Testing, Http library, Routing and Automation


Concise vs Explicit
* React trades concisness for being more explicit

* Two way (Knockout and Ember) vs one way binding (React)
* Two way binding keeps javascript values and inputs in Sync:

let user = "Cory";

<input
	type="text",
	value={user}
/>

* One way binding - requires more code

state = { user: "Bernie" }

function handleChange(event){
	this.setState({
		user: event.target.value
	});
}

<input
	type="text",
	value={this.state.user},
	onChange={this.handleChange}
/>

Benefits: we have control of precisely what happens on every event (can perform validation)

Template-centric vs JavaScript centric
Angular, View and Ember have JS in HTML
React has HTML in JS
