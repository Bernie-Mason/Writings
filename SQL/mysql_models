Modeling simplifies database design and maintenance by enabling you, the data architect, to visualize requirements and resolve design issues. Model-driven database design is an efficient methodology for creating valid and well-preforming databases, while providing the flexibility to respond to evolving data requirements. Models are used to build ER diagrams and physical MySQL databases.

Utilities:
	Create and manipulate a model graphically
	Reverse engineer a live database to a model
	Forward engineer a model to a script or live database.
	Create and edit tables and insert data
