Useful stuff SQL server

ctrl-shift-r - refresh local chance. Really useful if SQL server isn't remembering that you've created something new like a stored procedure.

In C#

If working this MSSQL you can create an MSSQL project.

Sample connection string:

SqlConnection myConnection = new SqlConnection("user id=BAN;" +
                                               "password=;" +
                                               "Data Source = (local);" +
                                               "Trusted_Connection=yes;" + 
                                               "database=Test; " + 
                                               "connection timeout=5");

Notes: For a SQL authentication the user id and password aren't necessary. 
	   The Date Source/Server/Address/Addr should always be (local) for a local database
