curl

Curl is command line tool for doing all sorts of URL manipulations and transfers. Curl is not written to do everything for you. It makes requests, it gets the data, it sends data and it retrieves the information.

The client, curl, sends a HTTP request. The request contains a mthod (like GET, POST, HEAD etc) a number of request headers and sometimes a request body. The HTTP server responds with a status line (indicating if things went well), response headers and most often a response body. The "body" part is the plain data you requested.

Options
	--verbose (-v)
		Yep. You want information  about commands sent to the server. Of course you do. Use verbose:
