Virtual box is a cross-platform virtualisation application. What does this mean? It installs on your Intel and AMD based computers whether they are running on Windows, Mac or Linux. It extends the capabilities of your existing computer so that it can run multiple operating systems (inside multiple virtual machines) at the same time.
