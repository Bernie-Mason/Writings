Flow Control: Branching with Case

Series of if commands are cumbersome and clunky. As in other programming languages case is better for situations where you have multiple choices.

case

The base multiple choice compound command = case. 

	case word in
			[pattern [| pattern]...) commads ;;]...
	esac

Let's remake the menu program from earlier chapters to use case to select the right command from the user:


#!/bin/bash

# case-menu: a menu driven system information program
  
clear

while [[ "$REPLY" != "q" ]]; do 

	cat <<- _EOF_
		Please Select:
	
		1. Display System Information
		2. Display Disk Space
		3. Display Home Space Utilisation
		q. Quit
	
	_EOF_
	read -p "Enter selection [1-3,q] > "
	
	case $REPLY in
		"q") 	echo "Program terminated."
				exit
				;;
		1) 		echo "Hostname: $HOSTNAME"
				uptime
				;;
		2) 		df -h
				;;
		3) 		if [[ $(id -u) -eq 0 ]]; then
					echo "Home Space Utilization (All Users)"
					du -sh /home/*
				else
					echo "Home Space Utilization ($USER)"
					du -sh $HOME
				fi
				;;
		*) 		echo "Invalid entry" >&2
				exit 1
				;;
	esac	
done
echo "Program terminated"

The case command looks at the value of word (REPLY in our example) and attempts to make it against one of the specified patters. When a match is found, the commands associated with the specified pattern are executed. After, a match is found, no further matches are attempted.

Patterns	
The patterns used by case are the same as those used by pathname expansion. Patterns are terminated with a ')' character.
	a) 				matches if word equals a
	[[:alpha:]] 	matches if word is a single alphabetical character
	???) 			matches if the word is exactly three characters long (unlike regex where . would be used instead of ?).
	*.txt) 			matches if word ends with characters .txt
	q|Q) 			matches if the word is q or Q
	*) 				matches any value of word. Good practise to include this as the last pattern in a case command  to catch any values of word that did not match a previous pattern; that is, to catch any possible invalid values.
