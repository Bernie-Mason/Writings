git commit -amend (-a) : amends to previous commit and performs git add .
git reset HEAD~1 : resets the index of the last commit but not the working tree (i.e. the changed files are preserved but not marked for commit) and reports what has not been updated (this is the --mixed option). --hard will also reset working tree
